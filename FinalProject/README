This folder contains the files for my ECE885 Final Project.

GRU_FBComments.py
This file runs the GRU RNN on all 5 dataset variants and attempts classifies them to one of the ranges of 
Facebook comments.

GRU2_FBComments.py
This file runs the GRU variant 2 RNN on all 5 dataset variants and attempts classifies them to one of the 
ranges of Facebook comments.

GRU_FBCommentsPrec.py
This files runs the GRU RNN on all 5 dataset variants and attempts to determine the exact number of
Facebook comments a post will generate.

GRU2_FBCommentsPrec.py
This files runs the GRU variant 2 RNN on all 5 dataset variants and attempts to determine the exact number 
of Facebook comments a post will generate.

__init__.py
This is an initialization file so recurrent_v.py works correctly.

recurrent_v.py
This file contains the variants of the LSTM and GRU RNNs so that they can be used by Keras.
Make sure this file and __init__.py are both in the same directy as GRU_FBComments.py, 
GRU2_FBComments.py, GRU_FBCommentsPrec.py, and GRU2_FBCommentsPrec.py when they are run.

Features_Variant_x.csv
These are the Facebook datasets that the RNNs are trained on.

Test_Case_x.csv
These are the Facebook datasets that the RNNs are validated on.
